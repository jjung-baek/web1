<p><p style="margin-top:45px;">Deputy Chief Constable of Essex Police Pippa Mills said the vehicle had been moved to a secure site at Tilbury Docks so the bodies of the 38 adults and one teenager could be "recovered while preserving the dignity of the victims".
She said identifying the deceased remained a "priority" but was expected to be a "lengthy process".<br>Meanwhile, officers from the Police Service of Northern Ireland have carried out raids on two houses associated with the arrested man - one in Markethill, County Armagh, and another in nearby Laurelvale.</p>
